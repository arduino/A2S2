# A2S2 by Arduino

This program is a proof of concept built from the code created for the
S2A project, a python bridge that helps communicating the offline version
of Scratch 2 (on Windows) with an Arduino board programmed with Firmata Plus

This code has been partly written from scratch partly reused from the
original S2A project. Work has been devoted to clear up the code to make
it easier to contribute. The UI has been left in English only as the
software requires a massive UX revision prior to including things like
multiple languages, adding extra Scratch programs, etc.

## LIMITATIONS

This is Windows-only application. Its guts are made in Python, which means it
can probably be converted to other OSs. It was built with Embarcadero's C++
builder, version 10.2, codename Tokyo.

For this program to run you will need to have installed Scratch 2 previously,
for it to work you will need to install Adobe AIR. You can find step-by-step
instructions on how to do this at: https://scratch.mit.edu/download

## TODO
* improve the process of capturing information from STDOUT and STDERR, a good article on the topic is: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/190351/how-to-spawn-console-processes-with-redirected-standard-handles
* make it multilingual using a *.po file system to allow easy ontributions by the community
* fix the UX flow of the program helping newcomers to install whatever they require for the program to work
* Making an application that runs only one instance at the time: https://www.tek-tips.com/viewthread.cfm?qid=1446136 (1st answer)

### USE IT!

1) download the latest release
2) unzip it anywhere on your computer
3) open the file A2S2_prj.exe (should have installed Scratch 2 before)
4) connect an Arduino Uno to your computer

5) the system will autodetect your board
6) "Fix Board" will install Firmata Plus on your board (the software needed to communicate with Scratch). It will do so by opening a command window and calling AVRDUDE, a program that uploads code to Arduino

7) "Launch A2S2" opens the Python server communicating Arduino to Scratch. It does so by opening a command window, do not close it! Also, you should wait until it is done launching the server (10s)

8) "Scratch 2" is the button that will open Scratch including the extension that can communicate to Firmata Plus
